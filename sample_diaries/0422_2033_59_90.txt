Today was a remarkable day for my IU fandom. I started the morning by watching a rerun of IU's concert online. Her voice is so soothing and powerful, it feels like a warm embrace every time I listen. In the afternoon, I spent some time organizing my IU merchandise – I have everything from posters to limited edition albums. It’s incredible how much joy these little items bring me.

In the evening, I joined a fan meeting online. It was so much fun discussing IU’s latest album with fellow fans from around the world. We shared our favorite tracks and even planned to start a fan project to celebrate her next anniversary. IU’s music and her warm personality are such an inspiration to me. I’m really looking forward to what she’ll do next. Being an IU fan brings so much positivity into my life, and I’m grateful for every moment of it.
