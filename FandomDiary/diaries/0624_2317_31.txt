Today was an exciting day as I managed to get tickets for IU's upcoming online fan meeting! I woke up early to ensure I didn’t miss out on the limited spots, and fortunately, I got one. I can’t wait to see her interact with fans live and maybe even get a chance to ask her a question.

In the afternoon, I watched some old interviews of IU, where she shared her thoughts on music and life. Her humility and passion for her craft are so inspiring. I spent the evening listening to her "Love Poem" album while doing some journaling. Each song feels like a personal message from her, and it always brings me comfort and joy.

I also connected with some friends in the IU fan community to discuss the fan meeting and our favorite IU moments. We’re planning to create a special fan video to show our appreciation. It’s amazing how IU’s music has brought us all together. I’m looking forward to the fan meeting and can’t wait to see what surprises IU has in store for us.
