Today was another delightful day dedicated to my love for IU. I woke up early to catch a live stream of her recent interview. She talked about her new projects and shared some behind-the-scenes stories from her latest music video shoot. Her insights and genuine personality always make these sessions so enjoyable.

In the afternoon, I decided to bake some cookies using a recipe IU once mentioned in a variety show. While baking, I played her "Through the Night" album, and the combination of her voice and the aroma of cookies created a perfect, cozy atmosphere. The cookies turned out delicious, making me feel even closer to IU in a way.

Later, I spent some time working on a fan art project. Drawing IU is always a pleasure because she has such expressive features and a radiant aura. I shared my artwork on social media, and it was heartwarming to see fellow fans appreciating and commenting on it.

In the evening, I re-watched IU’s drama "Hotel Del Luna." Her acting skills are just as impressive as her singing, and I get immersed in the story every time. It’s amazing how she can portray such a wide range of emotions so convincingly.

Before going to bed, I wrote a letter to IU, expressing how much her music and presence have positively impacted my life. Even though she might never read it, writing it made me feel more connected to her. Ending the day with gratitude, I look forward to another day filled with IU’s inspiration.
