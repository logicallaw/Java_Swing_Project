In the afternoon, I joined an online forum where fans were discussing their favorite IU songs. It was great to see so many people sharing their love for her music. We exchanged stories about how her songs have impacted our lives. One fan shared a touching story about how IU's music helped them through a difficult time, which made me appreciate her even more.

In the evening, I watched a live performance of IU from a previous concert. Her stage presence is truly captivating, and it felt almost like I was there in person. Watching her perform always fills me with so much energy and happiness.

Before going to bed, I read some of IU’s interviews where she talked about her creative process and what inspires her. Her dedication to her craft is truly inspiring. I’m so grateful to be a fan of such a talented and kind artist. Looking forward to what tomorrow brings in my journey as an IU fan.
