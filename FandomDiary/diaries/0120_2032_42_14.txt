Today, I woke up early because it’s the release day of IU's new album. I started my morning by watching the music video of the album's title track on YouTube. IU is as beautiful as ever, and her voice is so soothing that I think I'll be happy all day. In the evening, I organized my IU merchandise and talked with my friends about IU. We are all big fans of hers, and days like this are truly joyful. Tomorrow, there’s an event related to IU at the fan club, and I’m looking forward to it. I never knew being a fan of IU could bring so much happiness. Her music and the community of fans give me a lot of strength.
