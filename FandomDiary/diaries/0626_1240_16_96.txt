Today, the weather was incredibly hot. I started my day by listening to IU's latest album. Especially the song "Summer Dayâ€™s Melody" really matched the weather, making me feel refreshed. During lunch, to relieve some work stress, I re-watched a drama starring IU. Her acting was so outstanding that I couldn't help but be amazed. In the evening, I joined the fan club and discussed the new album with other fans. Seeing that many people share the same love for her music as I do made me even happier. Thanks to being a fan of IU, I had another happy day today. Tomorrow, I plan to read a book she recommended.
