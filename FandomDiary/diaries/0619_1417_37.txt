It’s party time
별이 깨어나는 까만 여름밤
It’s party time
너의 잠을 훔쳐 떠나 we go far

한 여름밤
숲속의 이야기를 만들어봐
Right here, just you and I (ahh)

터뜨려 Fireworks
신비한 일들이 일어날 거야
(Hey, buckle up, get ready, get ready to dance!)

눈을 맞춰
저 달이 반쯤 잠이 든 지금 이 순간
(Hey, buckle up, get ready, get ready to dance!)

이 숲속을
떠도는 hitchhiker
데려갈게
네가 원하는 location

Hey! 여기 이 순간에
Hey! The world just stop spinning
Hey! 끝이 없는 밤
Mixx it up, go!

Come on over right now
Come on over right now
Cuz party is not a party without you
Hurry up, join the party!

Waiting for you right now
Waiting for you right now
마법에 걸린 밤 꿈을 꿔 우린
You know that

Beep-beep Jingling Jingling
Keep-keep mingling mingling
You are my answer tonight (Don’t stop)

Beep-beep Jingling Jingling
Keep-keep mingling mingling
I’ll be your answer tonight (Don’t stop)

하나둘 모여들어 이건 party invitation
머리 위로 흩날리는 confetti
Get ready, celebration!

시작해 parade 우리의
Walking down Dream Avenue
꽃들의 환호 소리에 feeling so untrue

이 숲속에
자, 별가루를 뿌려
더 가볼게
닿지 못할 달의 station

Hey! Show your Face ID
Hey! Eye to eye with me
Hey! It’s unlocked baby
Swipe up, let’s go!

Come on over right now
Come on over right now
Cuz party is not a party without you
Hurry up, join the party!

Waiting for you right now
Waiting for you right now
마법에 걸린 밤 꿈을 꿔 우린
You know that

Beep-beep Jingling Jingling
Keep-keep mingling mingling
You are my answer tonight (Don’t stop)

Beep-beep Jingling Jingling
Keep-keep mingling mingling
I’ll be your answer tonight

NMIXX!

It’s party time

It’s a party, every time when you’re next to me
So now it’s a party tonight

It’s a party, every time when you’re next to me
So now it’s a party tonight

Come on over right now
