Today was filled with IU-related excitement from start to finish. I began my morning by watching an old episode of "Hyori’s Bed and Breakfast" where IU was a guest. Her kindness and down-to-earth nature always shine through in such shows, making her even more endearing.

In the afternoon, I visited a music store that had a special section dedicated to IU’s discography. Browsing through her albums and seeing her growth as an artist over the years was a nostalgic experience. I ended up buying a vinyl copy of her “Modern Times” album, which has always been one of my favorites.

After lunch, I joined a fan community’s online event where we played trivia games based on IU’s career. It was fun testing my knowledge and learning new facts about her. The sense of camaraderie among fans is truly special, and I made a few new friends who share the same passion for IU’s music.

In the evening, I took some time to learn the choreography for “BBIBBI.” It was challenging but incredibly fun. Dancing to IU’s songs adds another layer of appreciation for her talent, and it felt great to engage with her music physically.

Before bedtime, I spent some quiet time listening to IU’s ballads while reflecting on my day. Her voice has a calming effect that’s perfect for winding down. I’m grateful for the joy and inspiration IU brings into my life every day. Looking forward to tomorrow’s adventures as a devoted IU fan.
